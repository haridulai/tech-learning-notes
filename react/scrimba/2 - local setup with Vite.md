# Local setup w/Vite

## What I learned
- Installing Node and NPM (Node Package Manager)
  -- NVM or nvm-windows to manage node versions on a windows machine
- Installing a React project using Vite build tool

```
  npm create vite@latest

  project name: first-react
  framework: React
  variant: Javascript

  cd first-react

  npm install
  npm run dev

```

### Issues I face
- Ran into an issue using npm run dev with the Vite project because my node version was on 20 not the latest (22)

### Quick watch
- setup node and npm
  -- suggests using NVM
- npm create vita@latest
  --  Project name
  -- framework: React
  -- select a variant: JavaScript
- cd first-react
- npm i || npm install
- npm run dev
